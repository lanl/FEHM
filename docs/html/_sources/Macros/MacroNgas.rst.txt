|                |         |         |   is the temperature, and :math:`\rho_l` is the liquid                      |

The following is an example of ``ngas``. In this example, a full 3 degrees of
freedom solution is specified. The initial temperature at nodes 1 to 800 is 20
oC and the code is asked to calculate the initial noncondensible gas pressure.
There is no specified noncondensible gas source.
