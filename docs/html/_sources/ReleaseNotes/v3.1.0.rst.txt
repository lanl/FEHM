  @296:6096cf50b73d   16 months   rajesh  
  Changed model for calculation of fugacity in co2_properties module. Went back to the
  earlier formulation based on Span and Wagner.

  for calling co2_properties in other subroutines.

  This was done because the fugacity formulation requires density which is calculated
  with ther_co2_h2o with flag 0.
  Changed the formulation for calculating heat outflow bc in ther_co2_h2o.
  Modified output of zone fluxes.

  Changes to fix problems with sptr. In insptr insure dtmin is set to positive value, and freeze_time is correctly initialized. In ptrac3 add warning for illegal particle moves and check to make sure that for sptr2 for plumecalc output only occurs when a particle leaves a cell. For move particle remove old coding for random walk jumps in regular grids that erroneously exited loop at edge nodes. Add bilinear interpolation routine for type curve interpolation.

This macro is keyword based including phase and model type designations, to simplify inout of model parameters. A tabular input format has with linear interpolation has also been added.

  Fixed co2 code to correct enthalpy terms for water and co2 fluxes. Fixed upper limit check for saturation in vgrlps.
      
  @227:d63d8d72c24d   2 years zvd 
  Add check to ensure that the water saturation used to compute diffusion is between 0. to 1.0 so diffusion is computed correctly. Saturations lieing outside that range can lead to NaN's being computed and bad results.
      
  @226:63e74782ebc8   2 years zvd 
  Compute solute fluxes in terms of rcss instead of flow. That way solute movement by diffusion can be accounted for.
      
  @225:1bc1702c0e9b   2 years zvd 
  For runs with the well / river macro modified code to set header_flag to 'old', so restart file would be correct for runs with trac or ptrk.

  @206:49efd98cd146   2 years zvd

  @201:25f08da112b6   2 years zvd 
  Corrected trac output for Henry's Law species. For history output, the concentration values output were correct for the model component, but the headers were wrong for vapor species - reporting output as aqueous instead of vapor. For contour output, the aqueous values were always output instead of the vapor concnetrations when a vapor species was used.

  @74:1962ecdd3f0a    3 years zvd 
  Major revision/update of fehm-open: Version 3.00
  Added and changed routines to implement stress. Changes made to the stress-related subroutines to fix array addressing problems, simplify input, and allow for different conceptual models of aperture-displacement-stress relationships to be implemented. Split storsx into 3 parts to simplify modification. Added additional well bore gridding options. Added options to allow reading of different element conventions. Added a framework for specifying different wellbore physics. Added option for output of initial pressures and temperatures for stress calculations. MOdified submodel_bc to output boundary fluxes for keyword 'flux'. Added keyword 'all' to zone input to allow every node in grid to be put into a zone without having to specify coordinates.
      
  @75:1fec9a244f41    3 years zvd 
  Corrected inconsistency in number of parameters checked for rlp model 19.
      
  @70:56d6979c894f    3 years zvd
