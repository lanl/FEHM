# FEHM Version 3.6.2 - October 2024


## Summary

This group of subroutine updates includes improved phase change algorithms, saved zone usage, and boundary conditions primarily related to new isothermal two-phase flow with dissolved gas. Also updated zone_saved capability.

Code enhancements are generally related to improvements in numerical performance for the AMANZI isothermal, 2-phase, noncondensible,  gas-water  physics with  gas solubility. Included are subroutine changes to accommodate restarts with the new AMANZI physics.

- Added variables for global gas and dissolved gas, added  cnlof()for last times step dissolved gas

- Added tolerances for phase change, improved phase change (dissolved gas) algorithm

- Changed VG  upper/lower cutoff parameters

- Added coding to output isothermal multiphase solubility variables

- Added coding to read isothermal multiphase solubility variables

- Created new subroutine geneq2_sol to generate equations for iso 2phase with sol

- Added use module com_prop_data not used yet

- Added new subroutine inpress_solubility to read variables associated with isothermal two phase w solubility; added old mass fraction cnlof() set to cnlf()

- Modified code so initial liquid mass fraction is not read in ‘air’ keyword but in ‘pres’ keyword
FEHM V3.6 Release Notes

- Added coding to set phase state(ieos) based on initial conditions (including iso 2phase w sol)

- Modified boundary condition (kq = -202), corrected but in solubility calculation

- Modified code so upper cutoff is passed through subroutine header

- Some code corrections for simulations related to VV Test cases and how output files are written.

- Documentation has been changed from sphinx to github pages for easier updates. Missing pages and sections have been fixed. fehmpytests descriptions and instructions have been added.


## FEHM Testing Improvements

fehmpytests is a fast, easy to use set of test cases available with release V3.6.
It is multi-platform using python scripts to run and check results. This does not replace the VV Test Suite,
but is easier to use and faster to run. Instead of comparisons to analytical solutions, comparisons are made to verified output files. The VV Test Suite is still used and available under the release assets.f

The original VV test suite was developed for the YMP QA program V2.2 2003.
It continues to be the primary set of test cases used during code development,
but versions are platform dependent, it is large, and takes over 1.5 hours to run.
The test is driven by a combination of 20 year old perl scripts and FORTRAN executables that compare and write reports in a format used for YMP QA audits and reporting.


The linux VV Test Suite is from V3.3 release and does not include the updates made in the windows version. Some test cases may not run correctly or need updates to check output. It is still useful for checking single test cases.
VERIFICATION_V3.3.0lnx

There is no VV Test Suite for mac OSX at this time.

These 83 Windows VV Test cases were run and successful for this release.

The same test cases were run using the old VV Test case for Linux, VERIFICATION_V3.3.0lnx. All were successful except the following where old not updated test scripts failed (use fehmpytests instead):
barometric, infiltration_gdkm, divergence, forward, particle_capture, uz_test



## Code Bugs Fixed

## Known Issues

Problems compiling FEHM with Intel Visual Fortran for debugging. Checking out the flag "Check Routine Interfaces" in the "Diagnostics" option of the Fortran workspace properties can let compilation of FEHM go through.
