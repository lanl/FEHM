# FEHM Version 3.4.0 - September 2019





The major changes in the FEHM application from V3.3.1 to this release V3.4.0 are: salt and GDKM development, various modifications to improve the performance of FEHM simulation, fixing several known code bugs, and salt_test in V&V test suite was updated with improved theoretical solution (theoretical_result.txt).

See [PDF V3.4 Release Notes](ReleaseNotes_v3.4.0.pdf) for additional discussions:
- BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR THE AIR-WATER-HEAT MODULE IN FEHM AND A DESCRIPTION OF VERIFICATION PROBLEMS
- DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGH TEMPERATURE TABULAR WATER PROPERTIES CAPABILITY IN FEHM


## Enhancements

- Nonlinear rock heat capacity including rock melting. This capability allows the rock heat capacity with temperature dependence to be used in simulations. The numerical formulation for rock energy was modified to allow internal energy changes that represent rock melting. Several different heat capacity/melting models are available including input in tabular form. This capability will be fully tested and input/output described when the High Temperature version of FEHM is merged in the next release.

- Negative volume. A simple check for negative volumes associated with inconsistent local element node ordering was implemented.

- Humidity boundary conditions. Humidity boundary conditions were added to the BOUN macro.

- Gravity term correction. There are instances in multiphase simulations where a single phase gridblock is next to a multiphase block. In this case, it is possible that the density of one of the phases is not calculated for the single phase block. This affects the gravity term and is now corrected. (Seems to save a few iterations.) First discovered in TOUGH code at the University of Auckland.

- Salt project. Modified several of the salt routines. These changes were primarily for improvements to output. There are some computational efficiency improvements (saltctr).

- SRC_CH2017 (general). Moved vapor pressure lowering calls and improved the free drainage boundary condition for isothermal flow.

- Principal stress output. Changes the output for principal stress. Moved some arrays to use modules for improved efficiency.

- Saved Zone capability. This allows zones to be saved once and for all. This allows sets of zones not to lose nodes because of overlapping nodes defined sequentially. Useful for setting stratigraphy and boundary conditions and for outputting separate contour zones.

- GDKM. This is a major update to the GDKM capability. Corrected known bugs, simplified input, and added models. The models include the generic fracture model (similar to dpdp) and three directional fracture models.

## Code Bugs Fixed

1. varchk_2.f - fixed a bug in the variable update portion of routine for AWH and SC phase
2. resetv.f - fixed a bug. Now allows a timestep restart when a SC phase is present
3. Residual.f â€“ bug fix so that 135 Xe concentration test passes
4. Sub_gmres1.f - bug fix so that 135 Xe concentration test passes
5. thrmwc.f- continued improvement of ngas physics (AWH) boundary conditions, debugged and modified high temperature table
6. vcon.f - bug fix for earlier implementation of thermal conductivity for porosity above 0.3873 to FEHM. Included temperature dependence calculation and accurate linear slope equation for porosity above 0.3873 situation.


## Known Issues

08/29/2019: problems compiling FEHM with Intel Visual Fortran
Checking out the flag "Check Routine Interfaces" in the "Diagnostics" option of the Fortran workspace properties can let compilation of FEHM go through. There are two types of issues: 1) related to the setbit subroutine - the dummy arguments are all integer (4 bytes) while the third argument in the calling is of type real*8. Even if compilation goes through, it is not sure that results could be reliable; 2) there are many cases where the size of dummy arrays are larger than the ones in the calling sequence - but this is not a problem.
