|[**cellbased**](/test-details/cellbased.md)|**Test the Cell-Based Particle Tracking Model**<br>Compares the generated output files with the old files known be correct. All values are tested for a root mean square difference of less than 0.05.|
|[**colloid_filtration**](/test-details/colloid_filtration.md)|**Test Colloid Filtration**<br>Compares the generated ptrk files with the old ptrk files known to be correct.|
|[**dissolution**](/test-details/dissolution.md)|**Test the Dissoultion Macro**<br>A one-dimensional transport simulation of calcite (CaC03(s)) dissolution is tested. Profiles of concentration versus reactor length, at selected times, will be compared against the analytical solution.<br><br>Details of this test are described in the FEHM V2.21 Validation Test Plan on pages 93-95 (STN: 10086-2.21-00, Rev.No. 00, Document ID: 10086-VTP-2.21-00, August 2003.md)|
|[**doe**](/test-details/doe.md)|**Test the DOE Code Comparison Project, Problem 5, Case A**<br>Compares the generated contour and history files to old contour and history files that are known to be correct. For contour files, only the pressure, temperature, and saturation values at time 3 are tested. For history files, all pressure, temperature, and saturation values are tested.|
|[**dryout**](/test-details/dryout.md)|**Test Dry-Out of a Partially Saturated Medium**<br>Compares the generated contour files to old contour files known to be correct. The saturation is tested for all times.|
|[**head**](/test-details/head.md)|**Test Head Pressure Problem**<br>Compares the generated contour files to old contour files that are known to be correct. Only the pressure values at day 2 are tested.|
|[**heat_pipe**](/test-details/heat_pipe.md)|**Test the Heat Pipe Problem**<br>Compares the generated output files with the old files known to be correct. All values are tested.<br><br>RLPM subcases were excluded because they caused FEHM to produce too many negative volumes.|
|[**mptr**](/test-details/mptr.md)|**Test Multi-Species Particle Tracking**<br>Compares the generated ptrk files with the old ptrk files knonw to be correct.|
|[**multi_solute**](/test-details/multi_solute.md)|**Test Multi-Solute Transport with Chemical Reaction**<br>Compares the generated tracer files to old tracer files known to be correct. All concentraction values are tested.|
|[**ramey**](/test-details/ramey.md)|**Test Temperature in a Wellbore Problem**<br>Compares the generated contour and history files to old contour and history file that are known to be correct. For the contour files, only the temperature values at time 2 are tested. For the history files, all temperature values are tested.|
|[**richards**](/test-details/richards.md)|**Richards equation test**<br>Comparison of Richards equation with 2-phase solution Node by node comparison.|
|[**salt_perm_poro**](/test-details/salt_perm_poro.md)|**Test the Salt Permeability and Porosity Macro**<br>The porosity-permeability function for compacted salt from Cinar et at. (2006) is tested using a six node problem with porosities from 0.01 to 0.2. The excel spreadsheet in information/salt-perm-poro.xlsx contains calculations of the perm-poro function.<br><br>Cinar, Y, G Pusch and V Reitenbach (2006) Petrophysical and capillary properties of compacted salt.

|[**saltvcon**](/test-details/saltvcon.md)|**Test the Salt Variable Conductivity Macro**<br>Tests the calculations of thermal conductivity of crushed and intact salt.<br><br>Intact salt:<br>``kxi = k_{t-300}(300/T)^1.14`` *Munson et al. (1990) Overtest for Simulate Defense High-Level* *Waste (*Laboratories, SAND89-2671*<br><br>Thermal conductivity of crushed salt from Asse mine:<br>``kx_asse = -270*phi^4+370*phi^3-136*phi^2+1.5*phi+5`` *Bechtold et al. (2004) Backfilling and sealing of underground* *respositories for radioactive waste in salt *(BAMBUS II project), EUR 20621, ISBN 92-894-7767-9*<br><br>``kx = (k_{t-300}/kx_asse)*(300/T)^1.14`` if kx is less then 1.e-6, set to 1.e-6. If porosity is greater than 0.4, it is truncated as 0.4 since the Kx relationship is only valid within this range.<br><br>The excel spreadsheet /information/saltvcon.xlsx contains the associated calculations. |
