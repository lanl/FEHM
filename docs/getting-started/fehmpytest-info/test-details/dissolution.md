# dissolution

**Test the Dissoultion Macro**

A one-dimensional transport simulation of calcite (CaC03(s)) dissolution is tested. Profiles of concentration versus reactor length, at selected times, will be compared against the analytical solution.

Details of this test are described in the FEHM V2.21 Validation Test Plan on pages 93-95 (STN: 10086-2.21-00, Rev.No. 00, Document ID: 10086-VTP-2.21-00, August 2003.md)
