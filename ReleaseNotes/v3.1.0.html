-----------------------------------------
10/12/10

@229:18db16872dff   2 years zvd
Files changed and modified for a new style of rlp model input. Macro &quot;rlpm&quot; was added to the input to indicate the new style of rlp input should be used. This macro is keyword based including phase and model type designations, to simplify inout of model parameters. A tabular input format has with linear interpolation has also been added.

@228:f7a9b83f39be   2 years zvd
Fixed co2 code to correct enthalpy terms for water and co2 fluxes. Fixed upper limit check for saturation in vgrlps.

@227:d63d8d72c24d   2 years zvd
Add check to ensure that the water saturation used to compute diffusion is between 0. to 1.0 so diffusion is computed correctly. Saturations lieing outside that range can lead to NaN&#39;s being computed and bad results.

@226:63e74782ebc8   2 years zvd
Compute solute fluxes in terms of rcss instead of flow. That way solute movement by diffusion can be accounted for.

@225:1bc1702c0e9b   2 years zvd
For runs with the well / river macro modified code to set header_flag to &#39;old&#39;, so restart file would be correct for runs with trac or ptrk.

@224:c5fc17235ffa   2 years zvd
Modified the initialization of bigblock array when dealing with the gmres, b, and piv pointers.

@223:925262c1147b   2 years zvd
Modified check for permmodel to correctly read past input when model type 4 is used.

@222:71662dab50e3   2 years zvd
Modified code so &quot;chea&quot; variable is only used when the problem is not already a &quot;head&quot; problem. Setting the &quot;chea&quot; variable was causing double output of head.

@221:551098684a58   2 years zvd
Commented out variable declarations in comriv that could potentially be in conflict with variables in comwellphys. Commented out an unnecessary initialization in wellphysicsctr that used an unitialized variable index.

@220:8d76bcefacc2   2 years zvd
Added call variable type definitions to subroutine exit_pollock.

@219:c1c02ca32dd2   2 years zvd
Modified coding to not set ichead variable for a regular head problem and to only put out a single head value when chead is invoked.

@218:ee0e7c84cb0b   2 years zvd
Remove double + from dis equation.

@217:40f1ad3900de   2 years zvd

@211:6364768c4e5b   2 years gaz
Organized new use modules and minor changes

@208:2ba3b6b0d5d0   2 years zvd
Added additional write statement for output so solute identifier will be output for multiple species runs.

@207:12493f1b1e81   2 years zvd
Added coding to distribute solute entered as moles over complete specified zone when there is the possibility of overlap between zones that could reduce the number of nodes that the solute is distributed over.

@206:49efd98cd146   2 years zvd
Added coding to apply scaling of permeability (fperms) to models that include relative permeability. Arrays were added to save permeability scaling factors so they could be applied to rlp perms during a simulation.
Added reading of variable ihms to scanin so it can be used for some history plot set up if strs macro is not read before hist macro.

@205:6a8998a14b17   2 years zvd
Added coding to apply scaling of permeability (fperms) to models that include relative permeability. Arrays were added to save permeability scaling factors so they could be applied to rlp perms during a simulation.

@204:19fd1184147f   2 years zvd
Corrected indexing problem with particle output when particle restarts are used for the minimal (plumecalc style) sptr2 output. Also, added option to only output final particle location when particle time is greater than simulation time if an output end flag is set.

@203:73e4bd7e4863   2 years zvd
Corrected type decalrations for ncon and nop to integer in the routine to match the variables being passed in.

@202:a792c181091e   2 years zvd
Added deallocation of n_col variable when column data is being generated for a grid. Caused code crash on Windows PC when the already allocated array was reallocated when rereading the data from the just generated file.

@201:25f08da112b6   2 years zvd
Corrected trac output for Henry&#39;s Law species. For history output, the concentration values output were correct for the model component, but the headers were wrong for vapor species - reporting output as aqueous instead of vapor. For contour output, the aqueous values were always output instead of the vapor concnetrations when a vapor species was used.

@200:78589ef7794b   2 years zvd
Extend particle exclusion option to also exclude particles whose initial location places them at a node with porosity &lt;= 0.

@197:f8c72fc1cc21   3 years zvd

------------------------------------------
03/30/09 Version 3.00

@74:1962ecdd3f0a    3 years zvd
Major revision/update of fehm-open: Version 3.00
Added and changed routines to implement stress. Changes made to the stress-related subroutines to fix array addressing problems, simplify input, and allow for different conceptual models of aperture-displacement-stress relationships to be implemented. Split storsx into 3 parts to simplify modification. Added additional well bore gridding options. Added options to allow reading of different element conventions. Added a framework for specifying different wellbore physics. Added option for output of initial pressures and temperatures for stress calculations. MOdified submodel_bc to output boundary fluxes for keyword &#39;flux&#39;. Added keyword &#39;all&#39; to zone input to allow every node in grid to be put into a zone without having to specify coordinates.

@75:1fec9a244f41    3 years zvd
Corrected inconsistency in number of parameters checked for rlp model 19.

@70:56d6979c894f    3 years zvd
Modified to just use sk array when &#39;flux&#39; is the requested output for the submodel.
