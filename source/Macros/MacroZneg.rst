The zneg keyword is a problem solving tool that allows the user to zero out geometric coefficients that represent negative areas. It is useful for investigating causes of instability in highly-nonlinear simulations. A message will be written to the output file that states how many coefficients were set to zero.

Use with caution as the numerical grid will no longer be consistent in the mathematical sense.
