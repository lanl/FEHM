======
V3.2.0
======

The major changes in the FEHM application from V3.1 to this release V3.2, are
improvements to geothermal, CO2, and stress capabilities.
All changes are described in detail in release notes and Appendix documents
posted on fehm.lanl.gov web page. Enhancements to this FEHM release include:

* Additional stress models have been added, including stess permeability for shear-stimulated fractures and settings for incremental shear for porosity damage.

* Enhanced functionality for C02 problems have been added. The User Manual documentation has been updated for both "carb" and "grad". Output for macro "rlpm" has been generalized to include both co2 gas /water and co2 liquid /water output.

* For mass, energy balances in porous media, "anpe" (anisotropic permeability) has been modified to work with dual or dpdp or gdpm or gdkm for the isothermal case. The macro "anpe" works with "trac" for transport and "gdkm" works with isothermal and thermal.

* The macro "trxn" is a new macro, which does not add functionality but is a user-friendly interface to "trac" and "rxn".

  Summary of FEHM V3.2 Test Suite Additions
  
  The V&V Test Suite for V3.2 has the same test problems as releases V2.26 (for
  YMP QA) and V3.1 (April 2012). New test problems have been added to the test
  suite. After confirming successful tests on each operating system, a
  compressed archive file is created for each operating system; VERIFICATION_V3.2lnx.tar.gz, VERIFICATION_V3.2mac.tar.gz, and VERIFICATION_V3.2win.zip.
  
  
  The following is a partial list of the added tests (and associated test name): 
  
  Tests for macro co2 with co2pres, co2flow, and co2frac (co2test)
  Test the macro evap (evaporation)
  Test macros ngas and trac (wvtest)
  Tests for infiltration using the ecm and dpm models with Richardâ€™s equation
  (infiltration*)
  Test new concentration dependent density formulation (cden_test)
  Test concentration flux output option (cflxz_test)
  Test a new stress permeability model (stress_prem)
  Tests using the rlpm macro instead of the rlp macro, using both equation and
  table input.
  Tests using trxn format input in place of the trac and rxn macros.
  
  
  Developer Notes  9/27/2012 to 7/11/2013 -----------------------------  
  
  06/24-07/11/2013:
  Fixed GDKM problems and modified routines for improvement:
  
  area_length_calc.f - modified to make gdkm and anpe work, corrected routine so that cell dimensions are calculated for only the total gridblock dimensions in dpdp problems - not the primary and secondary volumes.
  incoord.f - modified to allow different ordering to 3D tets (variable ich_pebi)
  setparams.f - initialized  new variable ich_pebi
  comai.f  - added ich_pebi and other new variables 
  gncf3.f - added code to correct ordering for 3D tets if necessary(see variable ich_pebi)
  diskread.f- set some secondary stress variables to zero if primary stress variables are readi in
  ther_co2_h2o.f - changed (only) where some variables are declared. Now more are declared in comco2.f

  Ticket #13 (Manual Change to ngas) created by stauffer
  The secret flag is -666 for PCO2 (first ngas input values) and it allows the user to force zero water vapor in the problem, so that if you have saturation of zero you can run an air only (no water) problem. (only used without a restart file).
  
  The code always uses the temp and pressure of a restart file to calculate the initial partial pressure of noncondensible gas as PCO2 = Ptotal - Pwater vapor, where Pwater vapor is a function of temperature assuming 100% humidity.
