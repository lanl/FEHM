# non_darcy

**Test 2D Darcy and Non-Darcy Liquid and Gas**

This tests non linear flow using the macro **ndar**

Using the data from Zeng and Grigg (2006), these tests were designed to confirm the validity of the implementation. Both gas and liquid water pumping were examined in a 2D problem intended to approximate a pump test. Tests compare Darcy flow results with non-Darcy runs.

## Example macro ndar

The macro **ndar** is used to set non-darcy flow. The keyword *off* can be used to skip the macro and flow will be Darcy as usual. 

In this example, ```1 441 1``` is the node number start,stop,stride. ```1.0d9``` is the flow model which can be 1.d10, 1.d06, 1.0d9, and Beta default 1.d-15. Note for this test, 1.d06 is similar to the Darcy result, and 1.0d9 is slightly different (red lines in Figure 1).

<pre>
ndar
1 441 1 1.0d9

end ndar

or
ndar OFF (keyword **OFF** is used to skip a macro)

## Example macro cont with vtk

The vtk option is available through the macro **cont**. In this example, vtk contour files are written at Time 0.0 and Time 50.0  *rootname*.00001_sca_node.vtk and *rootname*.00002_sca_node.vtk, each with contour data for Liquid Pressure (MPa) and Saturation. The pressure contour images were created using Time 0002 vtk files.
