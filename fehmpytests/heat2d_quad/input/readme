checked the results in heat2d_quad.00003_hf_node.dat (dated Sept 23, 2014),
it agree with analytical solution as calculated below:

Heat copnduction:
q = k*delta-T/delta-L

K=2.7 W/m/degK
deltaT = 100 deg C
delta-L = 0.5m
q = 2.7*100/.5 =5.4e+2 (W/m/degK)*(degC)/m = 5.4e+2 W/m^2 
= 5.4e-4 MW/m^2
= 0.54e-3 MW/m^2

Check - works
