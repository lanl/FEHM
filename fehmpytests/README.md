## Fehmpytests python driven test suite for FEHM ##

Fehmpytests is a new test suite driver for FEHM. The goal is to enable FEHM developers to easily test new code and add new tests 
for existing or future functionality.  
There are about twenty tests that Fehmpytests performs through a command line interface. 
Future plans are to integrate it into the FEHM build process and provide more modularity by improving the developer interface.
