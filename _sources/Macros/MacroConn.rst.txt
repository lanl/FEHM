``conn``
========
Print number of connections for each node (after simplification of connectivity based on porosity) and stop. This macro can be used to determine if isolated nodes are left active after the porosity has been set to zero to deactivate the flow solution in portions of the grid. Poorly connected nodes cause problems with the particle tracking algorithms in FEHM.
