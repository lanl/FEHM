``finv``

Used so that FEHM calculates finite volume coefficients. No input or action is associated with this macro. This macro is on my default. 

Note that in previous versions of FEHM the default was to generate finite element coefficients instead of finite volume coefficients for the flow calculations. This can be performed by using macro nfinv.
